- **_Origin:_** OpIrRen, is a creation of Atheist Republicâ€™s Persian community.
- Our community sought to directly respond to the needs and pleas for help from our members living inside Iran amidst the current uprising and violent - crackdown by translating guides on how to protest safely and treat gunshot wounds. 
- However, we can not release these materials under the name of our current organization because atheism is punishable by death in Iran, so we must remove that affiliation from these manuals.
- We want these materials to be shared widely for maximum impact, so we must distance ourselves from any stigma or risk that would discourage distribution.
